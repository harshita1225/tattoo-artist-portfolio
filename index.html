            <h3>Minimalist Tattoos</h3>
            <p>
              Because minimalist tattoos tend to break designs down to basics,
              it works best with designs that can be visualized with a small
              number of lines or without a lot of complexity. Any color goes for
              minimalist tattoos as well, although black ink tends to be more
              common to keep the design as simple as possible.

            <h3>American Traditional Tattoos</h3>
            <p>
              This style has been going on for so long that it will never die,”
              notes Nealeigh. “It’s always good to look at a well-done
              traditional tattoo and know that it will last the tests of time.

            <h3>Watercolor Tattoos</h3>
            <p>
              “If a particular watercolor tattoo would include the color red, I
              will typically use at least five different red tones, from dark
              red to light red, in order to create a watercolor effect.”

            <h3>Geometric Tattoos</h3>
            <p>
              “When I choose a geometric design, I try to understand what kind
              of shapes will suit the person and the body part,” Shasho says. “I
              ask ... what shapes they like more—sharp, flow, organic,
              mechanical—so the person will have a connection to the tattoo as
              well.”

        <p>
          UV tattoos, or glow-in-the-dark tattoos, use vivid, fluorescent
          pigments that are difficult to view in daylight. However, under
          ultraviolet (UV) lights, these designs seem to glow thanks to the
          specific wave of light they omit. While glow-in-the-dark tattoos sound
          like they’d light up anywhere, the truth is that the effect only
          happens when viewing them under UV lights.
        </p>

          This style of tattoo became popular in the 1990s thanks to the neon
          trend and is still being experimented with (professionally and safely)
          in today’s tattoo scene. When the process was developed, artists used
          ink containing a carcinogen called phosphorous; now,
          traditional—albeit extremely bright—pigments are used to create the
          effect rather than dangerous chemicals.
